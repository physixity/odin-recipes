        <li>1 can SpaghettiOs</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>For the Oreo Topping:</li>

    <ol><h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <strong>Mountain Dew Reduction:</strong>
        <li>Pour the Mountain Dew into a saucepan and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and simmer until it's reduced to a thick syrup (about 1/4 cup). This may take around 30-40 minutes. Allow to cool.</li>

        <strong>Pizza Preparation:</strong>

        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of SpaghettiOs directly from the can onto the pizza base, ensuring you get some of those iconic round pasta shapes all over.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the SpaghettiOs.</li>

        <strong>Oreo Topping:</strong>
        <li>Sprinkle the crushed Oreos evenly over the cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the chocolate sauce in a zigzag pattern across the pizza.</li>

        <strong>Baking:</strong>
        <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>

        <strong>Serving:</strong>
        <li>Once out of the oven, drizzle the Mountain Dew reduction all over the pizza.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve while still warm, ensuring each slice gets a bit of all the quirky ingredients.</li>
